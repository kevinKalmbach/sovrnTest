Security
--------
Currently any user can all the "ad" endpoint and get back a tid which can then be used to call click.
This opens a security hole.

There are several ways to mitigate this.  one such way is to have the service that initially generates the request, create a signed request that includes the userid, tid, url, etc.
This signature then must accompany all requests (/ad and /click).  End users could not generate new requests and since the tid is part of the signature, it would be easy to trap replays attacks.



Database
--------
It seems apparent (but not explicitly stated) that this is a shared database.  (The schema is predefined, no mention of crud operation in the service, etc).  This violates one of the main tenets of services, owning your own data.


Problems With The Assignment
----------------------------
One problem with the assignment (as given) is in the sql to create the schema.  For the provider table, the sql is:
CREATE TABLE `provider` (
  `provider_id` INT NOT NULL,
  `provider_name` varchar(64) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  `url` varchar(512) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT UNIQUE,
  PRIMARY KEY (`provider_id`)
);

But you cannot have a string field be auto_increment (and it does not make any sense in this case).
Removing this allows the sql to be ran.

I would also suggest putting auto_increment in all the primary key columns.
